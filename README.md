Your organization wants to apply MERISE to design an information system. You are responsible for the analysis part, i.e., gathering the company's requirements. It has called on
a computer engineering student to carry out this project, and you must provide
him with the necessary information so that he can then apply the following
steps of database design and development himself.
First, establish the data business rules for your organization
in the form of a bulleted list. It must correspond to the information provided
by someone who knows how the company works, but not how an information system
is built.
Next, based on these rules, provide a raw data dictionary with the
following columns, grouped in a table: meaning of the data, type, size in
number of characters or digits. There should be between 25 and 35 data items.
